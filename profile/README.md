# Meet Differentiable Swift

Swift is a general-purpose programming language that is both approachable for
newcomers and powerful for experts. It is used to develop everything from apps
and system software to cloud services and embedded firmware, and runs on a
variety of platforms including macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Differentiable programming is a new paradigm for programming in which programs
can be differentiated throughout. This project adds first-class differentiable
programming to the Swift programming language.
